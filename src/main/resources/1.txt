Dataframes can be constructed from a wide array of sources, such as files, databases,
or custom data sources. The key concept of the dataframe is its API, which is available
in Java, Python, Scala, and R. In Java, a dataframe is represented by a dataset of rows:
Dataset<Row> .
Storage can be in memory or on disk, based on Spark’s strategy at the moment, but
it will use memory as much as it can.
Dataframes include the schema in a form of StructType , which can be used for
introspection. Dataframes also include a printSchema() method to more quickly
debug your dataframes. Enough theory—let’s practice!
